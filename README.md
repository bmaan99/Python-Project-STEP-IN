# Student management system with Python
This is my project for the STEP IN program in the Python Programming language. This project uses file handling. This can be used to store information about the students. It stores the roll number, name, and phone number of a student.
This program uses a multifile approach where each file is used to perform different purposes. This project enables users to add students, print all students, search for a student and remove a student from the database.
